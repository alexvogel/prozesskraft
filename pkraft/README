1) go to the directory where you want to install the toolbox and unpack
	tar -xvf pradar-0.5.0.tar.gz

2) link the launch script "bin/process" from a PATH-directory. for example
	cd ~/bin
	ln -s <installdirectory>/bin/pocess

6) edit all etc/pradar-*.ini
	define at least one license-server. "license-server-1=<port>@<server>"

now you can use the process-tools.

there are eventually other tools who need to know how to call bin/process. for example 'pramp'.
